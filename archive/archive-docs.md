# üóÉÔ∏è Archive Directory

*What is this folder?*  
This directory contains legacy, experimental, or deprecated code and tests. Nothing here is actively maintained, but it's kept for reference, learning, or possible future reuse.

## What's Inside
- Old models, scripts, and tests that are no longer part of the main workflow
- Experimental features or prototypes
- Code that may be useful for inspiration or migration

## How to Use
- Browse for reference or to recover useful ideas
- Do **not** use archived code in production or active development without review
- If you revive or update something, move it back to the main codebase and update documentation
